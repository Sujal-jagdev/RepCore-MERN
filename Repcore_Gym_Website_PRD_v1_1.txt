  - Section headers: Underline sweep on scroll into view.

- Micro-interactions:
  - Add to Cart: Button press scale + floating mini-cart nudge.
  - Wishlist: Heart pulse; toast confirmation.
  - Filters Drawer: Smooth open/close; content cross-fade.
- Accessibility: Prefers-reduced-motion respected; provide non-animated fallback.
- Implementation Notes: Encapsulate animations in hooks; clean up on unmount; guard SSR with “typeof window” checks.

8. Payment Gateway — Cashfree
Goal: Accept online payments via Cashfree with secure, compliant flows for India (UPI, cards, netbanking, wallets, pay later, EMI).

8.1 Flow (Server‑First)
1) Backend creates an Order (server) with amount, currency (INR), order_id, customer details.
2) Backend returns Cashfree order_token to the frontend.
3) Frontend initializes Cashfree’s Checkout SDK (Drop‑in or Hosted) using the order_token.
4) On success/failure/cancel, SDK triggers callback → frontend posts result to backend.
5) Backend verifies payment via Cashfree Orders API (server‑to‑server) using signature.
6) Webhook (notify_url) receives asynchronous payment events; verify signature; update order state.
7) Fulfilment: On verified “PAID”, move order to Packed/Ship; generate invoice; send confirmation email.
8) Refunds: Initiate via Cashfree Refunds API; sync status to order timeline.

8.2 Integration Details
- Environments: Sandbox and Production.
- Credentials: appId, secretKey stored only on server (env vars).
- SDK: Cashfree Checkout v3 (or latest), loaded only on payment pages.
- Webhooks: Secure with IP allowlist (if available), HMAC signature verification, idempotent handlers.
- Order States Mapping:
  - Cashfree: CREATED → AUTHORIZED → PAID → FAILED/VOIDED → REFUNDED
  - Repcore: Created → Paid → Packed → Shipped → Delivered (exceptions mapped accordingly)
- Error Handling: Clear retry for transient failures; COD fallback option.
- Reconciliation: Nightly job to cross‑verify orders via Cashfree API and flag mismatches.
- Compliance: Follow PCI DSS SAQ‑A (hosted fields/drop‑in), do not store card data.

8.3 UI Requirements (Checkout)
- Payment options list with logos; default to last used method.
- Progress indicator (Address → Payment → Review).
- Clear success page with order id, items, totals, and next steps.
- Failure page with reason, retry, and alternate methods.

9. Tech Requirements
- Frontend: React.js (or Next.js) + Tailwind/Bootstrap.
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js.
- Database: MongoDB.
- Auth: JWT + bcrypt; Nodemailer for OTP emails.
- Hosting: Vercel (Frontend) & Render/other (Backend).
- Payments: Cashfree (primary).

10. Environments & Config
- Dev → Staging → Production pipelines.
- Secrets via environment variables; separate keys per environment.
- Feature flags for risky changes (e.g., new PDP gallery).

11. Acceptance Criteria (Key)
- Admin can: create/edit products, variants, inventory; approve reviews; manage coupons; move orders across states; issue refunds; edit homepage banners.
- User can: register/login (OTP verify), browse and filter, add to cart, apply coupon, pay via Cashfree, receive confirmation.
- Motion: Animations load only once per route; no janky scroll; reduced‑motion honored.
- Performance: LCP <2.5s on 4G; CLS <0.1; TBT <200ms on mid‑tier device.
- Security: Auth routes protected; webhooks validated; admin routes role‑gated.

12. KPIs
- Conversion Rate, AOV, Checkout Abandonment, Page LCP, Refund Rate, Repeat Purchase Rate.

13. Risks & Mitigations
- Payment failures → Provide COD fallback and clear retry flows.
- Animation jank → Strict performance budget; throttle on low‑end devices.
- Catalog complexity → Bulk tools, saved filters, and audit logs.

14. Out of Scope (v1.1)
- Subscriptions, loyalty program, marketplace, multi‑currency.
- Advanced warehouse integrations.

15. Open Questions
- Shipping partner & label generation vendor?
- SMS/WhatsApp provider for transactional messages?
